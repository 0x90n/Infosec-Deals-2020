# Ongoing Infosec deals for 2019
This started off as a Black Friday thing, but I'm going to try and keep this updated as a side-project.

**Special thanks to [@Infosec_Taylor](https://twitter.com/Infosec_Taylor/), [0x90n](https://github.com/0x90n/InfoSec-Black-Friday/blob/master/README.md), and [webyeti](https://www.webyeti.ninja/blog/hackerblkfri) for keeping an eye on these this year. You should really follow them if you're looking for the most current, but this is fresh as of 7:30pm PT 11/29. You can find me on twitter [@davidscovetta](https://twitter.com/davidscovetta)**
